I created a simple flask webapplication to show the students of my class how http works

Type any name in https://httpdemopesce.herokuapp.com/
See the output on https://httpdemopesce.herokuapp.com/whatisname

You can use the curl command on the terminal to GET and POST to these URLs.

Try the following commands:

1. GET: curl https://httpdemopesce.herokuapp.com/
2. POST: curl -d "name=ruthu" -X POST https://httpdemopesce.herokuapp.com/
